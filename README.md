1) Bigger than previous
   Array of integers is given. Print all its elements, bigger than previous.
2) Neighbors of the same sign
   Array of n integers is given. Print the pairs of adjacent elements of the same sign. If there are no adjacent elements of the same sign, print nothing.
3) Maximum of absolute values
   The sequence of real numbers is given. Lets find their absolute values. Find the maximum value among these absolute values.
4) Difference between maximum and minimum
   Given n integers. Print the difference between the maximum and minimum number.
5) First the smallest
   Given an array of n integers. Find the smallest element of the array that occurs first and swap it with the first element of the array without changing the order of other elements.
6) The last the largest
   Given array of n integers. Find the largest element of the array that occurs the last and swap it with the last element in the array without changing the order of other elements.
7) More than average
   Given array of n integers. Find the sum and the number of integers, greater than the arithmetic average of array elements.
8) Swap the neighbours
   Given array of n integers. Swap the neighbouring elements of array (a[0] with a[1],a[2] with a[3] and so on). If there are odd number of elements, leave the last element of its place.
9) Invertor
   Given n integers. Print them in reverse order.
10) Divisible Sum Pairs
   You are given an array of integers A = (a0, a1, ... an-1) and a positive integer k. Find and print the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and ai+aj is divisible by k.
